# Maskify
This pipeline takes an image, creates segmentation masks of specified objects, and outputs the data as a binary .npy file.

# Overview
Given the following inputs from the user:
- the labels of objects to detect,
- image(s),
  
The pipeline creates segmentation masks based on the user's labels and outputs the data as a binary .npy file, where each pixel value represents either the background (0) or the object (1). This information can be used to randomize backgrounds, enhancing a model's ability to generalize across diverse scenarios and improving its robustness to environmental variations.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/hlenwng/maskify.git
```
2. Install dependencies with conda
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate maskify
pip install -e .
```

# Pipeline tutorial
1. Edit the example `labels.json` file with your list of object descriptions. 
- For example, "small white ceramic mug."
2. Upload your image(s) into the `images` folder
3. Run pipeline using:
```
python run_seg_to_binary.py
```
